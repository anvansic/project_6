Right-click the index.html file, and select "Open with" and then

## Playing the Game
Your character's sprite starts at the bottom of the screen. Use the arrow
keys (left, up, right, down) to move in those directions by one tile.
To win, move your character to the top of the board on one of the
water tiles. If your character touches one of the bugs running along
the stone tiles, you lose.
